# Volcanic Heat Diffusion With Cold Groundwater
### Otherwise known as VHDWCG (Pronounced Vuh Huh Duh Wuh Cuh Guh)
This is a very simple heat diffusion model made as a first order model for looking at how a near-surface water saturated layer affects the longevity of persistent melt in the crust, specifically in silicic systems
Or in other words... does big cold water make lava less hot??
